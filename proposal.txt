The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the association between groundwater arsenic concentrations and groundwater pH in the United States.  Data on arsenic concentrations and pH will be accessed through the National Water Quality Monitoring Council portal (https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal/).  Python will be used for data processing, exploratory analyses (e.g., descriptive statistics by state or region), and spatial regression.  Data will be visualized using GMT.
